Following is the script of the "How to eat vegan healthily" youtube video with the references to all claims we make. As much as possible we've only used scientific literature or sources of respected and generally accepted to be reliable organizations and made sure they always back up their claims with scientific literature.

SCRIPT
[Foreshadowing the video]

In this video we will show you how you can have a perfectly healthy plantbased diet based on the current scientific consensus. [Source that claims this is possible for all stages of life: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27886704/]

If you do eat or want to eat more plantbased, be sure to watch until the end, as although it is very possible; there are clear examples of vegan diets which are not healthy [Source that shows vegans who don't supplement B12 are at higher healthy risk: https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/11/12/3019]

We're basing this entire video on scientific literature and you can find a link to all our references in the description! We've ensured our sources are independent (without ulterior motive), basing their information on papers published in scientific journals.

Let me introduce to you the vegan pizza. It has 5 slices and a crust. Each of these sections represents one categorie of foods, like fruits and vegetables. The consensus is that if you eat a certain amount of each of these categories each day and vary within those catefories you will get all the nutritients you need.

This vegan pizza was created by a team of dietitians working with the Dutch Society for Veganism [Source: https://www.nieuwsvoordietisten.nl/nieuw-de-vegan-schijf/]

[TODO explain each sections (listing by showing many products within thaqt section) and then increasing a nutrients bar proportionally]

Let's start with the biggest sectionn: The vegetables. The recommended amount is at least 250 to 300 grams a day [https://www.veganisme.org/informatie/voeding/]

Then the second biggest section is the wholemeal grains. 


Here are all nutritients and things you might consider wanting to take into account into your diet. Here are the nutritients of which the current consensus claims you should keep an eye on. [include source]

If you eat the sections of the vegan pizza and vary, this is all the nutritients that you'll have sufficient amounts of. We see Iodine, Calcium, B12, D and Omega 3 DHA and EPA and water left over.

For your Iodine make sure to either eat bread with iodized salt, or seaweed, or iodized table salt. 

For your calcium we've included an inner section in the vegan pizza for calcium rich products. So be sure to also include them in your diet.

For the remaining nutritients we go to the crust of the vegan pizza which represents what you consume through water. So water and supplements. The current scientific consensus recommends supplementing B12, D and omega 3.
