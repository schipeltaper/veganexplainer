## Intro
**Welcome to this video on how to eat a healthy vegan diet based on the current scientific consensus!**

Images of vegan meals

**The vegan diet; a diet that excludes animal products like milk, eggs, beef and pork... In the past decade, we have seen a significant increase in the number of people interested in adopting such a diet. At the same time, there are quite some concerns and questions floating around about whether it is truly healthy and how to ensure you are getting all the nutrients your body needs.**

**That's why in this video, we set out to create a complete and simple overview on how you can eat a healthy plant-based diet. We will dive into the scientific research, and provide you with practical information on how to ensure you are getting all the nutrients your body needs. Whether you're already vegan, just starting out, or simply curious about a plant-based diet, this video will provide you with valuable information to help you optimize your health. So, let's get started!**

**And now... Let's get concrete and simple. And talk about HOW to eat a healthy vegan diet**

....


![VeganPizza](Poster-Vegan-Schijf-.png)
[Translated and taken from https://www.nieuwsvoordietisten.nl/nieuw-de-vegan-schijf/]

**Let me introduce you to the vegan plate. It has 5 slices and a crust. Each of these 6 sections represents one category of foods, like fruits and vegetables. The consensus is that if you eat a certain amount of each of these categories every single day and vary within those categories in general you should get all the nutrients you need.**
>   - [Dutch source explaining how to eat vegan](https://www.voedingscentrum.nl/nl/service/vraag-en-antwoord/gezonde-voeding-en-voedingsstoffen/hoe-kan-ik-gezond-veganistisch-eten-.aspx)

**This vegan plate might remind you of the commonly known food pyramid or food plate. And as you'll see this vegan plate has many similarities to those framworks except that it's completely vegan! The vegan plate was created by a team of dietitians working together with the Dutch Society for Veganism. They have ensured that people following the vegan plate will get you all the nutrients that their body needs.**
> [Source: NieuwsVoorDietisten](https://www.nieuwsvoordietisten.nl/nieuw-de-vegan-schijf/)
> [Food pyramid](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/healthy-eating-pyramid/)
> [Food plate](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/healthy-eating-plate/)

**When explaining the sections filled with a lot of carbohydrates, fats or protein, we won't go much into the details of HOW MUCH you need of those categories. As this depends on multiple factors which can differ a lot per person.**
> A few examples that show this:
>   - [*"To determine your daily protein intake, you can multiply your weight in pounds by 0.36"*](https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/how-much-protein-do-you-need-every-day-201506188096)
>   - [*"Your recommended calorie intake depends on various factors, like age and activity level."*](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/how-many-calories-per-day)
>   - [Factors that might affect your vitamin D levels: Where you live, Your age, Your skin color, Your weight, Certain health conditions](https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/taking-too-much-vitamin-d-can-cloud-its-benefits-and-create-health-risks)

**Let's start with the biggest section: Vegetables. The recommended amount is at least 250 to 300 grams per day.**
> [https://www.veganisme.org/informatie/voeding/](https://www.veganisme.org/informatie/voeding/)

**Then the second biggest section is the wholemeal grains (and potatoes). This section includes brown rice, potatoes, wholemeal bread, oats, wholemeal pasta. Being a good source for certain nutrients this section is partly how you get your complete protein from plants!**

**Which brings us to the next sections. Legumes! This includes peas, tofu, tempeh, chickpeas and all beans. Legumes are a great source for many essential nutrients and ontop of that legumes combined with a wholemeal grain can be considered a complete protein.**
>   - [Source](https://www.voedingscentrum.nl/nl/service/vraag-en-antwoord/gezonde-voeding-en-voedingsstoffen/waarom-hebben-vegetariers-en-veganisten-meer-eiwit-nodig-.aspx) that claims this. 
>   - [For example, grains like rice are too low in lysine to be considered a complete source of protein. Yet, by also eating lentils or beans, which are higher in lysine, throughout the day, you can be sure to obtain all nine essential amino acids](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/complete-protein-for-vegans#_noHeaderPrefixedContent)
>   - [Protein requiremens study](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/proceedings-of-the-nutrition-society/article/nutritional-value-of-plantbased-diets-in-relation-to-human-amino-acid-and-protein-requirements/BC1E672DD32895320E2A2C3DFA400A10)

**Factcheck me right now!**

**So examples of a complete protein could be:**
- **wholemeal bread with hummus**
- **Or brown rice with kidney beans**
- **Or wholemeal pasta with chickpeas!**

**And where are those vegetables from earlier? Oh! There they are**

**This actually look like a vary tasty dinner!**
> Source: My personal opinion :)

**If at any point this all seems like a lot to take in. There's no need to worry as in this video we'll gradually build up a complete and simple overview of all the essential practical information that you need to start pursuing a healthy plant-based diet.**

**Then our next section is fruit. The recommended amount is to eat 2 to 3 pieces of fruit every single day.**
> [https://www.veganisme.org/informatie/voeding/](https://www.veganisme.org/informatie/voeding/)

**Or alternatively, according to the National Health Service of the UK, when eating a vegan diet the recommended amount combined with is vegetables at least 5 portions (so for example 250 grams of vegetables and 2 pieces of fruit).**
> [https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/eat-well/how-to-eat-a-balanced-diet/the-vegan-diet/](https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/eat-well/how-to-eat-a-balanced-diet/the-vegan-diet/)

**Then our next slice is nuts, pips and seeds. Even though peanuts are technically a legume, nutrionally they are also in this section. So peanutbutter, chiaseeds, flaxseeds, walnuts, almonds, sesame seeds, tahini. They are all part of this seciton. Recommended is to eat at least a handfull of nuts every single day and once a week a handful extra.**
> [Hoe Kan Ik Gezond Veganistisch Eten](https://www.voedingscentrum.nl/nl/service/vraag-en-antwoord/gezonde-voeding-en-voedingsstoffen/hoe-kan-ik-gezond-veganistisch-eten-.aspx)

**Before we move to the final section: 'the crust', A few remarks about these 5 slices.**
**Firstly: it is crucial that you vary within each slice! When looking at fruits for example: that you eat a variety of fruits in your diet!**

**Secondly: calcium. They've included an inner section in the vegan plate for calcium rich products. So make sure to also include them in your diet. Calciumrich products include**
- **Green, leafy vegetables such as broccoli and cabbage**
> and okra, but not spinach (spinach does contain high levels of calcium but the body cannot digest it all)
- **Sesame seeds**
- **Tahini**
- **Dried fruit, such as raisins, prunes, figs, dried apricots**
- **Calcium-set tofu**
- **It is also often added to fortified foods to replace the animal-product. (CHECK THIS THOUGH)**

>   - Calcium: [*Plant-based milk/yoghurt alternatives, Green leafy vegetables, Fresh fruit, Dried fruit, Beans and pulses, Nuts and seeds, Bread products, Dried herbs and Other foods*](https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/howto/guide/best-vegan-calcium-sources) (follow the link for more detail)

**Thirdly: Iodine. For your iodine make sure to either eat bread with iodized salt, seaweed, or iodized table salt.**
>   - [https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/iodine/](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/iodine/)

**Finally: Iron. To make sure you get enough iron, it is recommended to pair iron with vitamin C in your meals, as this enhances your body's ability to absorb iron.**

**Foods rich in iron include**
- **This whole section of legumes**
- **Seeds, especially Pumpkin, sesame, hemp and flaxseeds**
- **Nuts, especially  almonds, cashews, pine nuts and macadamia nuts**
- **Leafy green vegetables**
- **Dried tomatoes or tomatoe paste**
- **Potatoes with skin**

**For vitamin C fruits and vegetables are the best sources of this nutrient.**
- **Citrus fruits and citrust juice (oranges, kiwi, lemon, grapefruit)**
- **Chard**
- **Red or green bell pepper**
- **Tomatoes**
- **Strawberries**
- **Cruciferous vegetables (broccoli, Brussels sprouts, cabbage, cauliflower)**
- **White potatoes**

**Here is a simple overview of what we've discussed thus far. The 5 slices, that you should vary within each slice and how to get enough iodine, calcium and iron**

**With all this in mind, let's take a look at the nutrients our sources say you should look out for when you stop eating animal products. It might seem like a lot, but don't get discouraged just yet! Here's the good news: if you follow the guidelines we've covered so far, you'll be getting sufficient amounts of all these nutrients in green.**

**If you are thinking of an essential nutrient that you think we should have mentioned, please look up what contains that nutrient and see if you can easily get sufficient amounts through following the vegan plate. We're willing to bet you can! In any case please share your findings in the comments!**

**3 nutrients remain that are not trivially sufficient with what we've discussed so far.**

> Wait, how can I trust you in that you really get all those nutrients? I'm glad you ask! In our references page we've included a table with all nutrients that you should look out for when having a vegan diet, and how you can get them through the vegan plate with references.
> Our nutrient table is [here](http://veganexplainer.pineapplees.com/nutrition)

> Plant-based sources of protein.

> Potassium: [*Dried fruits (raisins, apricots), Beans, lentils, Potatoes, Spinach, broccoli, Beet greens, Avocado, Bananas, Cantaloupe, Oranges, orange juice, Coconut water, Tomatoes, plant milks (soy, almond), Cashews, almonds*](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/potassium/)

> B6: [*"The best plant sources of vitamin B6 include nutritional yeast, muesli, fortified vegan breakfast cereals, avocados, pistachio nuts, wheat germ, acorn squash, banana, quinoa, sunflower seeds, corn on the cob, wholemeal spaghetti, Brussels sprouts, spring greens, chestnuts, hazelnuts, oranges, tahini (sesame seed paste), sesame seeds, tomatoes and walnuts."*](https://viva.org.uk/health/vitamin-b6-pyridoxine/)

> Vitamin D: [*Fortified foods, mushrooms and sunshine*](https://www.healthline.com/health/vegan-vitamin-d#vegan-sources)

> - [*Grain products tend to provide the highest levels of selenium but other foods like soy beans and tofu, along with certain nuts, seeds and different legumes also provide selenium. Consuming a variety of foods and including whole grains should help you to meet selenium requirements.*](https://lettucevegout.com/vegan-nutrition/selenium/)
>   - [*"Vegans in low selenium areas should eat Brazil nuts regularly"*](https://veganhealth.org/selenium/)

**For these remaining nutrients we go to the crust of the vegan plate which represents what you consume through water. So water and supplements. So the consensus recommends supplementing vitamin D, vitamin b12 and both omega 3 DHA and EPA.**

### Vitamin D

**Vitamin D deficiency is very common!**
> [*"About 1 billion people worldwide have vitamin D deficiency, while 50% of the population has vitamin D insufficiency"*](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/15050-vitamin-d-vitamin-d-deficiency)

**Vitamin D helps regulate the amount of calcium and phosphate in the body, which are needed to keep bones, teeth and muscles healthy. A lack of vitamin D can lead to bone deformities and bone pain. Other symptoms include: Fatigue, Not sleeping well, Depression or feelings of sadness, Hair loss, Muscle weakness, Loss of appetite, Getting sick more easily and Pale skin**
**If you don't want any those symptoms, even when not going vegan it can be recommended to supplement.**

**The National Health Service of the UK even says "Government advice is that everyone should consider taking a daily vitamin D supplement during the autumn and winter." They are refering to seasons with less sunlight, because when your skin is exposed to sunlight, it manufactures vitamin D**
> [https://health.unl.edu/9-vitamin-d-deficiency-symptoms-and-10-high-vitamin-d-foods](https://health.unl.edu/9-vitamin-d-deficiency-symptoms-and-10-high-vitamin-d-foods)
> [https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/vitamins-and-minerals/vitamin-d/](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/vitamins-and-minerals/vitamin-d/)
> [https://www.skincancer.org/blog/sun-protection-and-vitamin-d/](https://www.skincancer.org/blog/sun-protection-and-vitamin-d/)

**Alternatively to supplementation you can also consume foods fortified with vitamin D and certain mushrooms (CHECK YOURSELF IF IT'S ENOUGH)**
> [https://www.healthline.com/health/vegan-vitamin-d](https://www.healthline.com/health/vegan-vitamin-d)

**How much vitamin D you need depends on multiple factors; including where you live, age, skin color, weight, foods you eat, and certain health conditions.**
> [https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/taking-too-much-vitamin-d-can-cloud-its-benefits-and-create-health-risks](https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/taking-too-much-vitamin-d-can-cloud-its-benefits-and-create-health-risks)

**According to Harvard Medical School you probably don't need to supplement more than 15 to 20 mcg per day. Some may need a higher dose but unless your doctor recommends it, they say avoid taking more than 100 mcg per day.**
> [https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/taking-too-much-vitamin-d-can-cloud-its-benefits-and-create-health-risks](https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/taking-too-much-vitamin-d-can-cloud-its-benefits-and-create-health-risks)

**And beware that it might be added to your fortified foods, so check this!**

**To improve absorption of vitamin D, it can help to consume them with a meal containing dietary fats. So for example with your nuts, pips and seeds. Or with your olive- or coconot-oil**
> [Vitamin D is a fat-soluble vitamin, meaning that it does not dissolve in water and is absorbed best in your bloodstream when paired with high fat foods](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/best-time-to-take-vitamin-d#with-food)

### Omega 3
**This is the same for our next supplementation: omega-3**
> [*"How-ever, many of them are in ethyl ester formulations, from which EPA and DHA are poorly absorbed when consumed without a meal containing dietary fat."*](https://sciendo.com/article/10.5604/01.3001.0014.9343)

**Among other things Omega-3 fats appear to help the heart beat at a steady clip, lowers blood pressure and heart rate and improves blood vessel function.**
> [https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/what-should-you-eat/fats-and-cholesterol/types-of-fat/omega-3-fats/](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/what-should-you-eat/fats-and-cholesterol/types-of-fat/omega-3-fats/)

**Symptoms of Omega-3 deficiency include Skin irritation and dryness, Depression, Dry eyes, Joint pain and stiffness and changes in hair texture, integrity and density**
[https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/omega-3-deficiency#How-to-improve-omega-3-status](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/omega-3-deficiency#How-to-improve-omega-3-status)

**If you don't want those symptoms and would like to have a healthy cardiovasular system, stay tuned.**

**So there are three essential types of Omega 3: ALA, DHA and EPA. If you follow the guidelines that we've covered thus far, you should be getting sufficient ALA**
> [Source ALA is in chia seeds](https://www.vegansociety.com/resources/nutrition-and-health/nutrients/omega-3-and-omega-6-fats)
> [Source ALA is in the other mentioned products](https://academic.oup.com/ajcn/article/100/suppl_1/443S/4576604)

**Then there are two other forms of omega 3: DHA and EPA. Your body does convert ALA into DHA and EPA but this conversion isn't very efficient, so on a plant-based diet it is recommended to supplement 250 to 500 mg of combined EPA and DHA every single day.**
> [https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/how-much-omega-3#general-guidelines](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/how-much-omega-3#general-guidelines)
> [Omega-3 Fatty Acids NIH](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Omega3FattyAcids-HealthProfessional/)**There is no established Upper Limit (UL) of omega-3 EPA+DHA, but it is recommended not to consume too much. "according to the European Food Safety Authority, long-term consumption of EPA and DHA supplements at combined doses of up to about 5 g/day appears to be safe" and "Similarly, the FDA has concluded that dietary supplements providing no more than 5 g/day EPA and DHA are safe when used as recommended". It's regarded safe and but it's not necessary and there are some reasons for not taking so much: "The IOM did not establish a UL for any omega-3s, although it noted that high doses of DHA and/or EPA (900 mg/day of EPA plus 600 mg/day DHA or more for several weeks) might reduce immune function due to suppression of inflammatory responses". This is why we'll recommend less than 1 gram per day.**

### B12
**And finally, arguably the most important nutrient of this video: vitamin B12**

**Among other things vitamin B12 keeps the nervous system healthy. Symptoms of a deficiency include: extreme tiredness, a lack of energy, pins and needles, a sore and red tongue, mouth ulcers, muscle weakness, problems with your vision, psychological problems, which can range from mild depression or anxiety to confusion and dementia, and problems with memory, understanding and judgement**
[https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/vitamin-b12-or-folate-deficiency-anaemia/](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/vitamin-b12-or-folate-deficiency-anaemia/)

**Again some pretty intense stuff which you van avoid by supplementing!**

**Instead of supplementing you can also consume foods which are fortified with vitamin B12 (CHECK THIS THOUGH)**

**A type of B12 is in some natural plantbased products, but this type is not properly absorbed, and so currently the only consensus on a reliable source of vitamin B12 is through either supplementation or fortified products.**

**If you're doing a daily supplementation take at least 10mcg per day**
**and at most 1000 mcg a day.**
**This maximum is so high because B12 is a water-soluble (Unlike D and Omega-3) vitamin which makes high doseges generally considered safe.**

**Because B12 is water-soluble, you don't need to consume them with food. Although you can take and absorb B12 at any time during the day, mornings are recommended due to their important role in nutrient metabolism and energy production.**
> [https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/best-time-to-take-vitamins#water-soluble-vitamins](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/best-time-to-take-vitamins#water-soluble-vitamins)

### Pro tips 
And now, for some extra tips:

**Should I take mulivitamin? Harvard School Of Public Health says "For those who eat a healthful diet, a multivitamin may have little or no benefit. A diet that includes plenty of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, good protein sources, and healthful fats should provide most of the nutrients needed for good health." And concludes by saying "a multivitamin CANNOT in any way replace a healthful well-balanced diet. The main purpose of a multivitamin is to fill in nutritional gaps, and provides only a hint of the vast array of healthful nutrients and chemicals naturally found in food"**

**Beware that replacement products for cows milk, yoghurt, cheese and meat are often fortified with nutrients. Eating nutrients through fortified foods are another way to get your D, calcium, iron, B12 and Omega3. If you choose to eat these kinds of products, check how much of the nutritients are added to balance out with your supplements and make sure you don't over-supplement any nutrient.**
