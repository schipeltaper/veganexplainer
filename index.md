## Intro
**Welcome to this video on how to eat a healthy vegan diet based on the current scientific consensus!**

Images of vegan meals

**The vegan diet; a diet that excludes animal products like milk, eggs, beef and pork... In the past decade, we have seen a significant increase in the number of people interested in adopting such a diet. At the same time, there are quite some concerns and questions floating around about whether it is truly healthy and how to ensure you are getting all the nutrients your body needs.**

**That's why in this video, we set out to create a complete and simple overview on how you can eat a healthy plant-based diet. We will dive into the scientific research, and provide you with practical information on how to ensure you are getting all the nutrients your body needs. Whether you're already vegan, just starting out, or simply curious about a plant-based diet, this video will provide you with valuable information to help you optimize your health. So, let's get started!**

**Let me introduce to you the vegan plate. It has 5 slices and a crust. Each of these 6 sections represents one category of foods, like fruits and vegetables. The consensus is that if you eat a certain amount of each of these categories every single day and vary within those categories in general you should get all the nutrients you need.**
>   - [Dutch source explaining how to eat vegan](https://www.voedingscentrum.nl/nl/service/vraag-en-antwoord/gezonde-voeding-en-voedingsstoffen/hoe-kan-ik-gezond-veganistisch-eten-.aspx)

****

**This vegan plate might remind you of the commonly known food pyramid or food plate. Well, as you'll see this vegan plate has many similarities with that framework except that it's completely vegan! It has been created by a team of dietitians working together with the Dutch Society for Veganism. They have ensured that people following the vegan plate will get you all the nutrients that their body needs.**
> [Source: NieuwsVoorDietisten](https://www.nieuwsvoordietisten.nl/nieuw-de-vegan-schijf/)

**When explaining the sections filled with a lot of carbohydrates, fats or protein, we won't go much into the details of HOW MUCH you need of those categories. As this depends on multiple factors which can differ a lot per person.**
> A few examples that show this:
>   - [*"To determine your daily protein intake, you can multiply your weight in pounds by 0.36"*](https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/how-much-protein-do-you-need-every-day-201506188096)
>   - [*"Your recommended calorie intake depends on various factors, like age and activity level."*](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/how-many-calories-per-day)
>   - [Factors that might affect your vitamin D levels: Where you live, Your age, Your skin color, Your weight, Certain health conditions](https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/taking-too-much-vitamin-d-can-cloud-its-benefits-and-create-health-risks)

**Let's start with the biggest section: The vegetables. The recommended amount is at least 250 to 300 grams per day.**
> [https://www.veganisme.org/informatie/voeding/](https://www.veganisme.org/informatie/voeding/)

**Then the second biggest section is the wholemeal grains (and potatoes). This includes brown rice, potatoes, wholemeal bread, oats, wholemeal pasta. Being a good source for certain nutrients this section is partly how you get your complete proteins from plants!**

**Which brings us to the next sections. Legumes! This includes peas, tofu, tempeh, chickpeas and all beans. Legumes are a great source for many essential nutrients and ontop of that legumes combined with a wholemeal grain can be considered to make a complete protein.**
>   - [Source](https://www.voedingscentrum.nl/nl/service/vraag-en-antwoord/gezonde-voeding-en-voedingsstoffen/waarom-hebben-vegetariers-en-veganisten-meer-eiwit-nodig-.aspx) that claims this. 
>   - [For example, grains like rice are too low in lysine to be considered a complete source of protein. Yet, by also eating lentils or beans, which are higher in lysine, throughout the day, you can be sure to obtain all nine essential amino acids](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/complete-protein-for-vegans#_noHeaderPrefixedContent)

**Factcheck me right now!**

**So examples of a complete protein could be:**
- **wholemeal bread with hummus**
- **Or brown rice with kidney beans**
- **Or wholemeal pasta with chickpeas!**

**And where are those vegetables from earlier? Oh! There they are**

**This actually look like a vary tasty dinner!**
> Source: My personal opinion :)

**If at any point this all seems like a lot to take in. There's no need to worry as in this video we'll gradually build up a complete and simple overview of all the essential practical information for you to start pursuing a healthy plant-based diet.**

**Then our next section is fruit. The recommended amount is to eat 2 to 3 pieces of fruit every single day.**
> [https://www.veganisme.org/informatie/voeding/](https://www.veganisme.org/informatie/voeding/)

**Or alternatively, according to the National Health Service of the UK, when eating a vegan diet the recommended amount combined with is vegetables at least 5 portions (so for example 250 grams of vegetables and 2 pieces of fruit).**
> [https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/eat-well/how-to-eat-a-balanced-diet/the-vegan-diet/](https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/eat-well/how-to-eat-a-balanced-diet/the-vegan-diet/)

**Then our next slice is nuts, pips and seeds. Even though peanuts are technically a legume, nutrionally they are also in this sections. So peanutbutter, chiaseeds, flaxseeds, walnuts, almonds, sesame seeds, tahini. They are all part of this seciton. Recommended is to eat at least a handul of nuts every single day and once a week a handful extra.**

**We have now arrived at the final section of the vegan plate: the crust**

**But first, our research has shown that there are certain nutrients you should be mindful of when you stop eating animal products. Looking at the list of those nutrients, it might seem like a lot. But here's the good news: if you follow the guidelines we've already covered, you'll be getting sufficient amounts of all these nutrients in green.**

**Now, let's talk about the remaining nutrients. You might find that you're already consuming many of these nutrients. It's simpeler than you think, so sit tight and stay tuned.**

**For your calcium they've included an inner section in the vegan plate for calcium rich products. So make sure to also include them in your diet. Calciumrich products include**
- **Green, leafy vegetables such as broccoli, cabbage and okra, but not spinach (spinach does contain high levels of calcium but the body cannot digest it all)**
- **Sesame seeds**
- **Tahini**
- **Dried fruit, such as raisins, prunes, figs and dried apricots**
- **Calcium-set tofu**
- **It is also often added to fortified foods to replace the animal-product. (CHECK THIS THOUGH)**

**3 nutrients to go! We're almost there. If you are thinking of a nutrient that you think we should have mentioned, please look up what contains that nutrient and see if you can easily get sufficient amounts through following this vegan pizza. We're willing to bet you can! In any case please share your findings in the comments!**

**For the remaining nutrients we go to the crust of the vegan plate  which represents what you consume through water. So water and supplements. So the consensus recommends supplementing B12, D and both omega 3 DHA and EPA.**

### Vitamin D

**Vitamin D deficiency is very common!**
> [*"About 1 billion people worldwide have vitamin D deficiency, while 50% of the population has vitamin D insufficiency"*](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/15050-vitamin-d-vitamin-d-deficiency)
**Vitamin D helps regulate the amount of calcium and phosphate in the body, which are needed to keep bones, teeth and muscles healthy. A lack of vitamin D can lead to bone deformities and bone pain. Other symptoms include: Fatigue, Not sleeping well, Depression or feelings of sadness, Hair loss, Muscle weakness, Loss of appetite, Getting sick more easily and Pale skin**
**If you don't want any those symptoms, even when not going vegan it can be recommended to supplement.**

**The National Health Service of the UK even says "Government advice is that everyone should consider taking a daily vitamin D supplement during the autumn and winter." They are refering to seasons with less sunlight, because when your skin is exposed to sunlight, it manufactures vitamin D**
> [https://health.unl.edu/9-vitamin-d-deficiency-symptoms-and-10-high-vitamin-d-foods](https://health.unl.edu/9-vitamin-d-deficiency-symptoms-and-10-high-vitamin-d-foods)
> [https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/vitamins-and-minerals/vitamin-d/](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/vitamins-and-minerals/vitamin-d/)
> [https://www.skincancer.org/blog/sun-protection-and-vitamin-d/](https://www.skincancer.org/blog/sun-protection-and-vitamin-d/)

**Alternatively to supplementation you can also consume foods fortified with vitamin D and certain mushrooms (CHECK YOURSELF IF IT'S ENOUGH)**
> [https://www.healthline.com/health/vegan-vitamin-d](https://www.healthline.com/health/vegan-vitamin-d)

**How much vitamin D you need depends on where you live, age, skin color, weight, foods you eat, and certain health conditions.**
> [https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/taking-too-much-vitamin-d-can-cloud-its-benefits-and-create-health-risks](https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/taking-too-much-vitamin-d-can-cloud-its-benefits-and-create-health-risks)

**According to Harvard Medical School you probably don't need to supplement more than 15 to 20 mcg per day. Some may need a higher dose but unless your doctor recommends it, avoid taking more than 100mcg per day.**
> [https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/taking-too-much-vitamin-d-can-cloud-its-benefits-and-create-health-risks](https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/taking-too-much-vitamin-d-can-cloud-its-benefits-and-create-health-risks)

**And beware that it might be added in your fortified foods, so you can check that!**

**To improve absorption of D, it can help to consume them with a meal containing dietary fats. So with your nuts, pips and seeds. Or with olive- or coconot-oil**
> [Vitamin D is a fat-soluble vitamin, meaning that it does not dissolve in water and is absorbed best in your bloodstream when paired with high fat foods](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/best-time-to-take-vitamin-d#with-food)

### Omega 3
**This is the same for our next supplementation: omega-3**
> [*"How-ever, many of them are in ethyl ester formulations, from which EPA and DHA are poorly absorbed when consumed without a meal containing dietary fat."*](https://sciendo.com/article/10.5604/01.3001.0014.9343)

**Among other things Omega-3 fats appear to help the heart beat at a steady clip, lowers blood pressure and heart rate and improves blood vessel function.**
> [https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/what-should-you-eat/fats-and-cholesterol/types-of-fat/omega-3-fats/](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/what-should-you-eat/fats-and-cholesterol/types-of-fat/omega-3-fats/)

**Symptoms of Omega-3 deficiency include Skin irritation and dryness, Depression, Dry eyes, Joint pain and stiffness and changes in hair texture, integrity and density**
[https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/omega-3-deficiency#How-to-improve-omega-3-status](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/omega-3-deficiency#How-to-improve-omega-3-status)

**If you don't want those symptoms and would like to have a healthy cardiovasular system, stay tuned.**

**There are three essential types of Omega 3: ALA, EPA and DHA. If you follow the guidelines that we've covered thus far, you should be getting sufficient ALA**
> [Source ALA is in chia seeds](https://www.vegansociety.com/resources/nutrition-and-health/nutrients/omega-3-and-omega-6-fats)
> [Source ALA is in the other mentioned products](https://academic.oup.com/ajcn/article/100/suppl_1/443S/4576604)

**Then there are two other forms of omega 3: EPA and DHA. Your body does convert ALA into DHA and EPA but this conversion isn't very efficient, so on a plant-based diet it is recommended to supplement 250 to 500 mg of combined EPA and DHA every single day.**
> [https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/how-much-omega-3#general-guidelines](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/how-much-omega-3#general-guidelines)

### B12
**Finally, arguably the most important nutrient of this video: vitamin B12**

**Among other things vitamin B12 keeps the nervous system healthy. Symptoms of a deficiency include: extreme tiredness, a lack of energy, pins and needles, a sore and red tongue, mouth ulcers, muscle weakness, problems with your vision, psychological problems, which can range from mild depression or anxiety to confusion and dementia, and problems with memory, understanding and judgement**
[https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/vitamin-b12-or-folate-deficiency-anaemia/](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/vitamin-b12-or-folate-deficiency-anaemia/)

**Again some pretty intense stuff which you van avoid by supplementing!**

**Instead of supplementing you can also consume foods which are fortified with B12 (CHECK THIS THOUGH)**

**A type of B12 is in some natural plantbased products, but this type is not properly absorbed, and so currently the only consensus on a reliable source of vitamin B12 is through either supplementation or fortified foods.**

**If you're doing a daily supplementation take at least 10mcg per day**
**and at most 1000 mcg.**
**This maximum is so high because B12 is a water-soluble (Unlike D and Omega-3) vitamine which makes high doseges generally considered safe.**

**Because B12 is water-soluble, you don't need to consume them with food. Although you can take and absorb B12 at any time during the day, mornings are recommended due to their important role in nutrient metabolism and energy production.**
> [https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/best-time-to-take-vitamins#water-soluble-vitamins](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/best-time-to-take-vitamins#water-soluble-vitamins)

> If you only supplement weekly, it is recommended to take at least 2000mcg. I know, daily at least 10, weekly at least 2000? The numbers don't add up! This is just how vitamin b12 works. You can check the following reference if you want to learn more!

### Recap
**This was the vegan plate. So if you eat each of these 6 sections every single day and vary within those sections and make sure to include enough iodine and calcium in your diet according to the consensus you will get all the nutrients that you need.**
**If you can think of anyone who might benefit from this video, please feel free to share this. Thank you for watching! Goodbye**

### Pro tips 
And now, for some extra tips:

**Should I take mulivitamin? Harvard School Of Public Health says "For those who eat a healthful diet, a multivitamin may have little or no benefit. A diet that includes plenty of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, good protein sources, and healthful fats should provide most of the nutrients needed for good health." And concludes by saying "a multivitamin CANNOT in any way replace a healthful well-balanced diet. The main purpose of a multivitamin is to fill in nutritional gaps, and provides only a hint of the vast array of healthful nutrients and chemicals naturally found in food"**
>   - [Should I Take a Daily Multivitamin?](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/multivitamin/)

**Beware that replacement products for cows milk, yoghurt, cheese and meat are often fortified with nutrients. Eating nutrients through fortified foods are another way to get your D, calcium, iron, B12 and Omega3. If you choose to eat these kinds of products, check how much of the nutritients are added to balance out with your supplements and make sure you don't over-supplement any nutrient.**
> [Are Fortified and Enriched Foods Healthy?](https://www.healthline.com/health/food-nutrition/fortified-and-enriched-foods)

**The official Dutch dietary advisory organization 'Voedingscentrum' says these foods can be healthy if they contain less than 1.1 grams salt per 100 gram.**
[Voedingscentrum](https://www.voedingscentrum.nl/nl/service/vraag-en-antwoord/gezonde-voeding-en-voedingsstoffen/hoe-kan-ik-gezond-veganistisch-eten-.aspx)

**In a meal, vitamin C rich products enhances the absorption of iron, so it can be beneficial to combine these two during your meals.**
>   - [*"Ascorbic acid is a powerful enhancer of nonheme iron absorption"*](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/6940487/) (Vitamin C is a powerful enhancer of iron absorption)

**For example**
- **Bell peppers with beans**
- **Or lemon with lentils**
- **Or tomatoes with chickpeas**
- **Or brussel sprouts with potatoe with skin**
- **Or strawberries with nuts?**

**Or any other combination**
