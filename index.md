# Scientific References

Following is the script of the **"How to eat vegan healthily"** youtube video with the references to all claims we make.

### SCRIPT

[Foreshadowing the video]
**According to the academy of Nutrition and Dietetics appropriately planned vegan diets are healthful and nutritionally adequate for all stages of the life cycle, and also for athletes.**

**In this video we will show you how you can have a perfectly healthy plantbased diet based on the current scientific consensus.**

> Sources that claim this is possible: 
>  - [National Library of Medicine](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27886704/) *"appropriately planned vegetarian, including vegan, diets are healthful, nutritionally adequate, and may provide health benefits for the prevention and treatment of certain diseases."*
> - [Voedingscentrum](https://www.voedingscentrum.nl/nl/service/vraag-en-antwoord/gezonde-voeding-en-voedingsstoffen/hoe-kan-ik-gezond-veganistisch-eten-.aspx) Translated from Dutch: *"How can I eat vegan healthily?"* followed by a detailed explanation.

> - For athletes: [*"it is the contention of this article that a nutritive vegan diet can be designed to achieve the dietary needs of most athletes satisfactorily"*](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28924423/)

**If you do eat or want to eat more plantbased, be sure to watch until the end. As although it is very possible, there are clear examples of vegan diets which are not healthy.**

**Let me introduce to you the vegan pizza. It has 5 slices and a crust. Each of these 6 sections represents one category of foods, like fruits and vegetables. The consensus is that if you eat a certain amount of each of these categories each day and vary within those categories you will get all the nutrients you need.**

> [Source: NieuwsVoorDietisten](https://www.nieuwsvoordietisten.nl/nieuw-de-vegan-schijf/)

**Explaining each section, we will not go into the details of HOW MUCH you need of each category. As this depends on multiple factors which are not the same for everyone.**
> A few examples that show this:
>   - [*"To determine your daily protein intake, you can multiply your weight in pounds by 0.36"*](https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/how-much-protein-do-you-need-every-day-201506188096)

**Let's start with the biggest section: The vegetables. The recommended amount is at least 250 to 300 grams a day.**
> [https://www.veganisme.org/informatie/voeding/](https://www.veganisme.org/informatie/voeding/)

**Then the second biggest section is the wholemeal grains (and potatoes). This includes rice, potatoes, wholemeal bread, oats, wholemeal pasta. Being a good source for certain nutrients it is also partly how you get your complete proteins from plants!**

**Which brings us to the next sections. Legumes! This includes peas, tofu, tempeh, chickpeas and all beans. Legumes are a great source of many essential nutrients PLUS legumes combined with a wholemeal grain can be considered to make a complete protein.**
>   - [Source](https://www.voedingscentrum.nl/nl/service/vraag-en-antwoord/gezonde-voeding-en-voedingsstoffen/waarom-hebben-vegetariers-en-veganisten-meer-eiwit-nodig-.aspx) that claims this. 
>   - [For example, grains like rice are too low in lysine to be considered a complete source of protein. Yet, by also eating lentils or beans, which are higher in lysine, throughout the day, you can be sure to obtain all nine essential amino acids](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/complete-protein-for-vegans#_noHeaderPrefixedContent)

**For example**
- **wholemeal bread with hummus**
- **Brown rice with beans**
- **Wholemeal pasta with chickpeas**

**And where are those vegetables from earlier?**

**This all is actually a really good dinner!**
> Source: My personal opinion :)

**If at any point this all seems like a lot to take in, I recommend watching until the end as we'll include some nice sources that you can go to if you want to pursue eating a healthy plant-based diet**

**Then our next section is fruit. The recommended amount is at least 2 to 3 pieces of fruit every day.**
> [https://www.veganisme.org/informatie/voeding/](https://www.veganisme.org/informatie/voeding/)

**Or combined with vegetables at least 5 portions (so for example 250 grams of vegetables and 2 pieces of fruit).**

**Then our next slice is nuts, pips and seeds. Even though peanuts are technically a legume, nutrionally they are also a part of this sections. So peanutbutter, flaxseeds, walnuts, sesame seeds. Recommended is to at least include a handul of nuts a day and once a week some more**

**If you eat these 5 slices of the vegan pizza (without the crust!) and vary within each slice, this is all the nutritients that you'll have sufficient amounts of. We see Iodine, Calcium, B12, D and Omega 3 DHA and EPA and water left over as not being trivially sufficient.**

**Wait, how can I trust you in that you really get all those nutrients? I'm glad you ask! In our references page we've included a table with all nutrients that you should look out for when having a vegan diet, and how you can get them through the vegan pizza with references.**

**For your calcium we've included an inner section in the vegan pizza for calcium rich products. So be sure to also include them in your diet. Calciumrich products include**
- **Green, leafy vegetables such as broccoli, cabbage and okra, but not spinach (spinach does contain high levels of calcium but the body cannot digest it all)**
- **Sesame seeds**
- **Tahini**
- **Dried fruit, such as raisins, prunes, figs and dried apricots**
- **Calcium-set tofu**
- **It is also often added to fortified foods to replace the animal-product. (CHECK THIS THOUGH)**

**3 nutrients to go! We're almost there. If you are thinking of a nutrient that you think we should have mentioned, please look up what contains that nutrient and see if you can easily get sufficient intake by following this vegan pizza. We're willing to bet you can! In any case please share your findings in the comments!**

**For the remaining nutrients we go to the crust of the vegan pizza which represents what you consume through water. So water and supplements. The current scientific consensus recommends supplementing B12, D and omega 3.**

### Vitamin D

**Vitamin D deficiency is very common, so even when not going vegan it can be recommended to supplement.**
> [*"About 1 billion people worldwide have vitamin D deficiency, while 50% of the population has vitamin D insufficiency"*](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/15050-vitamin-d-vitamin-d-deficiency)

**Or you can consume foods fortified with vitamin D and certain mushrooms (CHECK YOURSELF IF IT'S ENOUGH)**
> [https://www.healthline.com/health/vegan-vitamin-d](https://www.healthline.com/health/vegan-vitamin-d)

**How much vitamin D you need depends on where you live, age, skin color, weight, foods you eat, and certain health conditions.**
> [https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/taking-too-much-vitamin-d-can-cloud-its-benefits-and-create-health-risks](https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/taking-too-much-vitamin-d-can-cloud-its-benefits-and-create-health-risks)

**According to Harvard Medical School you probably don't need to supplement more than 15 to 20 mcg per day. Some may need a higher dose but unless your doctor recommends it, avoid taking more than 100mcg per day.**
> [https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/taking-too-much-vitamin-d-can-cloud-its-benefits-and-create-health-risks](https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/taking-too-much-vitamin-d-can-cloud-its-benefits-and-create-health-risks)

**And beware that it might be added in your fortified foods, so you can check that!**

### Omega 3
**There are three essential types of Omega 3: ALA, EPA and DHA. ALA is contained in vegetable oils and nuts (especially walnuts), chia seed, flax seeds and flaxseed oil and leafy vegetables. So you will get this easily when following the vegan pizza.**
> [Source ALA is in chia seeds](https://www.vegansociety.com/resources/nutrition-and-health/nutrients/omega-3-and-omega-6-fats)
> [Source ALA is in the other mentioned products](https://academic.oup.com/ajcn/article/100/suppl_1/443S/4576604)

**Then there are two other forms of omega 3: EPA and DHA. Your body converts ALA into DHA and EPA but this conversion isn't very efficient, so on a plant-based diet it is recommended to supplement 250 to 500 mg combined EPA and DHA for healthy adults.**
> [https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/how-much-omega-3#general-guidelines](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/how-much-omega-3#general-guidelines)

**To improve absorption of these supplements, it can help to consume them with a meal containing dietary fats. So with your nuts, pips and seeds. Or with olive- or coconot-oil**
> [*"How-ever, many of them are in ethyl ester formulations, from which EPA and DHA are poorly absorbed when consumed without a meal containing dietary fat."*](https://sciendo.com/article/10.5604/01.3001.0014.9343)

### B12
**Then finally and maybe most importantly! The only essential nutrient that you can not naturally get by eating plant-based foods. And so on a plantbased diet you absolutely need to supplement: Vitamin B12.**

**Instead of supplementing you can also consume foods which are fortified with B12 (CHECK THIS THOUGH)**

**A type of B12 is in some natural plantbased products, but this type is not properly absorbed, and so currently the only consensus on a reliable source of vitamin B12 is through supplementation or fortified foods.**

**If you're doing a daily supplementation take at least 10mcg per day**
**and at most 1000 mcg.**
**This maximum is so high because B12 is a water-soluble vitamine which makes high doseges generally considered safe.**

**If you only supplement weekly, it is recommended to take at least 2000mcg. I know, daily at least 10, weekly at least 2000. The numbers don't add up, but trust me. This is just how vitamin b12 works. You can check the references if you want to learn more!**

### Recap
This completes the vegan pizza! 5 slices and a crust. If you eat each of these sections every day and vary within each slice and make sure to include calcium rich products, the current consensus says you will get all nutritients you need.

### Pro tips
And now, for some extra tips:

**Should I take mulivitamin? Harvard School Of Public Health says "For those who eat a healthful diet, a multivitamin may have little or no benefit. A diet that includes plenty of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, good protein sources, and healthful fats should provide most of the nutrients needed for good health." And concludes by saying "a multivitamin CANNOT in any way replace a healthful well-balanced diet. The main purpose of a multivitamin is to fill in nutritional gaps, and provides only a hint of the vast array of healthful nutrients and chemicals naturally found in food"**
>   - [Should I Take a Daily Multivitamin?](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/multivitamin/)

**Beware that replacement products for cows milk, yoghurt, cheese and meat are often fortified with nutrients. Eating nutrients through fortified foods are another way to get your D, calcium, iron, B12 and Omega3. If you choose to eat these kinds of products, check how much of the nutritients are added to balance out with your supplements and make sure you don't over-supplement any nutrient.**
> [Are Fortified and Enriched Foods Healthy?](https://www.healthline.com/health/food-nutrition/fortified-and-enriched-foods)

**The official Dutch dietary advisory organization 'Voedingscentrum' says these foods can be healthy if they contain less than 1.1 grams salt per 100 gram.**
[Voedingscentrum](https://www.voedingscentrum.nl/nl/service/vraag-en-antwoord/gezonde-voeding-en-voedingsstoffen/hoe-kan-ik-gezond-veganistisch-eten-.aspx)

**In a meal, vitamin C rich products enhances the absorption of iron, so it can be beneficial to combine these two during your meals.**
>   - [*"Ascorbic acid is a powerful enhancer of nonheme iron absorption"*](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/6940487/) (Vitamin C is a powerful enhancer of iron absorption)

**For example**
- **Bell peppers with beans**
- **Or lemon with lentils**
- **Or tomatoes with chickpeas**
- **Or brussel sprouts with potatoe with skin**
- **Or strawberries with nuts?**

**Or any other combination**
