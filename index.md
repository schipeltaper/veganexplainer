# Scientific References

Following is the script of the "How to eat vegan healthily" youtube video with the references to all claims we make. As much as possible we've only used scientific literature or sources of respected and generally accepted to be reliable organizations and made sure they always back up their claims with scientific research.

### SCRIPT

[Foreshadowing the video]

**In this video we will show you how you can have a perfectly healthy plantbased diet based on the current scientific consensus.**

> Sources that claim this is possible: 
>  - [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27886704/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27886704/) *"appropriately planned vegetarian, including vegan, diets are healthful, nutritionally adequate, and may provide health benefits for the prevention and treatment of certain diseases."*
> - https://www.voedingscentrum.nl/nl/service/vraag-en-antwoord/gezonde-voeding-en-voedingsstoffen/hoe-kan-ik-gezond-veganistisch-eten-.aspx Translated from Dutch: *"How can I eat a vegan healthily?"* followed by a detailed explanation.

**Let me introduce to you the vegan pizza. It has 5 slices and a crust. Each of these sections represents one categorie of foods, like fruits and vegetables. The consensus is that if you eat a certain amount of each of these categories each day and vary within those catefories you will get all the nutritients you need.**
> Dutch source explaining how to eat vegan: https://www.voedingscentrum.nl/nl/service/vraag-en-antwoord/gezonde-voeding-en-voedingsstoffen/hoe-kan-ik-gezond-veganistisch-eten-.aspx]

**This vegan pizza was created by a team of dietitians working with the Dutch Society for Veganism.**
> Source: https://www.nieuwsvoordietisten.nl/nieuw-de-vegan-schijf/

**The size of each slice represents how much grams is recommended to take relative to each other.**

**Let's start with the biggest sectionn: The vegetables. The recommended amount is at least 250 to 300 grams a day.**
> https://www.veganisme.org/informatie/voeding/

**Then the second biggest section is the wholemeal grains (and potatoes). This includes rice, potatoes, wholemeal bread, oats, wholemeal pasta. Being a good source for certain nutrients it is also partly how you get your complete proteins from plants!**

**Which brings us to the next sections. Legumes! This includes peas, tofu, tempeh, chicpeas and all beans. Legumes are a great source of many essential nutrients PLUS lgeumes combined with a wholemeal grain can be considered to make a complete protein.**
> Source that claims this https://www.voedingscentrum.nl/nl/service/vraag-en-antwoord/gezonde-voeding-en-voedingsstoffen/waarom-hebben-vegetariers-en-veganisten-meer-eiwit-nodig-.aspx

**
For example
- wholemeal bread with hummus
- Brown rice with beans
- Wholemeal pasta with chicpeas

And where are those vegetables from earlier?

"This all is actually a really good dinner!"
**

**Then our next section is fruit. The recommended amount is at least 2 to 3 pieces of fruit every day.**
> https://www.veganisme.org/informatie/voeding/

**Or combined with vegetables at least 5 portions (so for example 250 grams of vegetables and 2 pieces of fruit).**
> https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/eat-well/how-to-eat-a-balanced-diet/the-vegan-diet/

**Then our next slice is nuts, pips and seads. Eventhough peanuts are technically a legume, nutrionally they are also a part of this sections. So peanutbutter, flaxseeds, walnuts, sesame seeds. Recommended is to at least include a handul of nuts a day and once a week some more**
> [https://www.voedingscentrum.nl/nl/service/vraag-en-antwoord/gezonde-voeding-en-voedingsstoffen/hoe-kan-ik-gezond-veganistisch-eten-.aspx]

**Here is a list of all nutrients of which the consensus says you might want to look out for when you stop eating animal products.
- Protein * + -
- Iron * +
- Vit B1 *
- Vit B2 * -
- Vit B3 -
- Vit B12 * + -
- Calcium * + -
- Potassium -
- Vit B6 [https://europepmc.org/article/med/1797957]
- Vit D * + -
- Iodine * + -
- Omega-3 fatty acids +

**If you eat these slices of the vegan pizza and vary within each slice, this is all the nutritients that you'll have sufficient amounts of. We see Iodine, Calcium, B12, D and Omega 3 DHA and EPA and water left over as not being trivially sufficient.**

**For your Iodine make sure to either eat bread with iodized salt, or seaweed, or iodized table salt.**
> https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/iodine/

**For your calcium we've included an inner section in the vegan pizza for calcium rich products. So be sure to also include them in your diet. Calciumrich products include
- green, leafy vegetables such as broccoli, cabbage and okra, but not spinach (spinach does contain high levels of calcium but the body cannot digest it all)
- sesame seeds and tahini
- dried fruit, such as raisins, prunes, figs and dried apricots
- calcium-set tofu
- It is also often added to fortified foods to replace the animal-product. (CHECK THIS THOUGH)
**
> https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/eat-well/how-to-eat-a-balanced-diet/the-vegan-diet/

**For the remaining nutritients we go to the crust of the vegan pizza which represents what you consume through water. So water and supplements. The current scientific consensus recommends supplementing B12, D and omega 3.**

###Vitamin D

**Vitamin D deficiency is very common, so even when not going vegan it can be recommended to supplement.**
> https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/15050-vitamin-d-vitamin-d-deficiency *"About 1 billion people worldwide have vitamin D deficiency, while 50% of the population has vitamin D insufficiency"*

**How much vitamin D you need depends on where you live, age, skin color, weight, foods you eat, and certain health conditions.**
> https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/taking-too-much-vitamin-d-can-cloud-its-benefits-and-create-health-risks

**According to Harvard Medical School you probably don't need to supplement more than 15 to 20 mcg per day. Some may need a higher dose but unless your doctor recommends it, avoid taking more than 100mcg per day.**
> https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/taking-too-much-vitamin-d-can-cloud-its-benefits-and-create-health-risks]

**And beware that it might be added in your fortified foods, so you can check that!**

### Omega 3
**There are three essential types of Omega 3: ALA, EPA and DHA. ALA is contained in vegetable oils and nuts (especially walnuts), chia seed, flax seeds and flaxseed oil and leafy vegetables. So you will get this easily when following the vegan pizza.**
> Source ALA is in chia seeds: https://www.vegansociety.com/resources/nutrition-and-health/nutrients/omega-3-and-omega-6-fats
> Source ALA is in the other mentioned products: https://academic.oup.com/ajcn/article/100/suppl_1/443S/4576604

**Then there are two other forms of omega 3: EPA and DHA. Your body converts ALA into DHA and EPA but this conversion isn't very efficient, so on a plant-based diet it is recommended to supplement 250 to 500 mg combined EPA and DHA for healthy adults**
> https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/how-much-omega-3#general-guidelines

### B12
**Then finally and maybe most importantly! The only essential nutrient that you can not naturally get by eating plant-based foods. And so on a plantbased diet you absolutely need to supplement: Vitamin B12.**
> https://www.vegansociety.com/resources/nutrition-and-health/nutrients/vitamin-b12/what-every-vegan-should-know-about-vitamin-b12

**Instead of supplementing you can also consume foods which are fortified with B12 (CHECK THIS THOUGH)**

**A type of B12 is in some natural plantbased products, but this type is not properly absorbed, and so currently the only consensus on a reliable source of vitamin B12 is through supplementation or fortified foods.**
> https://www.vegansociety.com/resources/nutrition-and-health/nutrients/vitamin-b12/what-every-vegan-should-know-about-vitamin-b12

**If you're doing a daily supplementation take at least 10mcg per day**
> https://www.vegansociety.com/resources/nutrition-and-health/nutrients/vitamin-b12]
**and at most 1000 mcg.**
> https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/taking-too-much-vitamin-d-can-cloud-its-benefits-and-create-health-risks
**This maximum is so high because B12 is a water-soluble vitamine which makes high doseges generally considered safe.**
> https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/too-much-vitamin-b12#helpful-or-harmful

**If you only supplement weekly, it is recommended to take at least 2000mcg. I know, daily at least 10, weekly at least 2000. The numbers don't add up, but trust me. This is just how vitamin b12 works. You can check the references if you want to learn more!**

### Recap
And so this completes the vegan pizza! 5 slices and a crust. If you eat each of these sections every day and vary within each slice and make sure to include calcium rich products, the current consensus says you will get all nutritients you need.

### Ending and further sources
We haven't at all discussed practical aspects: of the kinds of meals you can make and how. So if you want to go further and more practical, we've included some sources in the description that you can look into.

And if you know someone who might benefit from this, please do share this video. We'd really appreciate it! And it makes us very happy to read your feedback and thoughts in the comments! So feel free to do so :) BYEE
