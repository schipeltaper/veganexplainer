Following is the script of the "How to eat vegan healthily" youtube video with the references to all claims we make. As much as possible we've only used scientific literature or sources of respected and generally accepted to be reliable organizations and made sure they always back up their claims with scientific literature.

SCRIPT
[Foreshadowing the video]

In this video we will show you how you can have a perfectly healthy plantbased diet based on the current scientific consensus. [Source that claims this is possible for all stages of life: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27886704/]

If you do eat or want to eat more plantbased, be sure to watch until the end, as although it is very possible; there are clear examples of vegan diets which are not healthy [Source that shows vegans who don't supplement B12 are at higher healthy risk: https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/11/12/3019]

We're basing this entire video on scientific literature and you can find a link to all our references in the description! We've ensured our sources are independent (without ulterior motive), basing their information on papers published in scientific journals.
