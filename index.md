Following is the script of the "How to eat vegan healthily" youtube video with the references to all claims we make. As much as possible we've only used scientific literature or sources of respected and generally accepted to be reliable organizations and made sure they always back up their claims with scientific literature.

SCRIPT
[Foreshadowing the video]

In this video we will show you how you can have a perfectly healthy plantbased diet based on the current scientific consensus. [Source that claims this is possible for all stages of life: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27886704/]

If you do eat or want to eat more plantbased, be sure to watch until the end, as although it is very possible; there are clear examples of vegan diets which are not healthy [Source that shows vegans who don't supplement B12 are at higher healthy risk: https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/11/12/3019]

We're basing this entire video on scientific literature and you can find a link to all our references in the description! We've ensured our sources are independent (without ulterior motive), basing their information on papers published in scientific journals.

Let me introduce to you the vegan pizza. It has 5 slices and a crust. Each of these sections represents one categorie of foods, like fruits and vegetables. The consensus is that if you eat a certain amount of each of these categories each day and vary within those catefories you will get all the nutritients you need. [Dutch source explaining how to eat vegan: https://www.voedingscentrum.nl/nl/service/vraag-en-antwoord/gezonde-voeding-en-voedingsstoffen/hoe-kan-ik-gezond-veganistisch-eten-.aspx]

This vegan pizza was created by a team of dietitians working with the Dutch Society for Veganism [Source: https://www.nieuwsvoordietisten.nl/nieuw-de-vegan-schijf/]. The size of each slice represents how much grams is recommended to take relative to each other. 

[TODO explain each sections (listing by showing many products within thaqt section) and then increasing a nutrients bar proportionally]

Let's start with the biggest sectionn: The vegetables. The recommended amount is at least 250 to 300 grams a day [https://www.veganisme.org/informatie/voeding/]

Then the second biggest section is the wholemeal grains (and potatoes). This includes rice, potatoes, wholemeal bread, wholemeal pasta. Being a good source for certain nutrients it is also partly how you get your complete proteins from plants!

Which brings us to the next sections. Legumes! This includes peas, tofu, tempeh, chicpeas and all beans. Legumes are a great source of many essential nutrients PLUS lgeumes combined with a wholemeal grain can be considered to make a complete protein [Source that claims this https://www.voedingscentrum.nl/nl/service/vraag-en-antwoord/gezonde-voeding-en-voedingsstoffen/waarom-hebben-vegetariers-en-veganisten-meer-eiwit-nodig-.aspx]

For example
- wholemeal bread with hummus
- Brown rice with beans
- Wholemeal pasta with chicpeas

And where are those vegetables from earlier?

"This all is actually a really good dinner!"

Then our next section is fruit. The recommended amount is at least 2 to 3 pieces of fruit every day [https://www.veganisme.org/informatie/voeding/]. Or combined with vegetables at least 5 portions (so for example 250 grams of vegetables and 2 pieces of fruit) [https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/eat-well/how-to-eat-a-balanced-diet/the-vegan-diet/]

Then our next slice is nuts, pips and seads. Eventhough peanuts are technically a legume, nutrionally they are also a part of this sections. So peanutbutter, flaxseeds, walnuts, sesame seeds. Recommended is to at least include a handul of nuts a day and once a week some more [https://www.voedingscentrum.nl/nl/service/vraag-en-antwoord/gezonde-voeding-en-voedingsstoffen/hoe-kan-ik-gezond-veganistisch-eten-.aspx]

Here are all nutritients and things you might consider wanting to take into account into your diet. Here are the nutritients of which the current consensus claims you should keep an eye on. [include source]

If you eat the sections of the vegan pizza and vary, this is all the nutritients that you'll have sufficient amounts of. We see Iodine, Calcium, B12, D and Omega 3 DHA and EPA and water left over.

For your Iodine make sure to either eat bread with iodized salt, or seaweed, or iodized table salt. [https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/iodine/]

For your calcium we've included an inner section in the vegan pizza for calcium rich products. So be sure to also include them in your diet. Calciumrich products include - green, leafy vegetables such as broccoli, cabbage and okra, but not spinach (spinach does contain high levels of calcium but the body cannot digest it all)
- sesame seeds and tahini
- dried fruit, such as raisins, prunes, figs and dried apricots
- calcium-set tofu
- It is also often added to fortified foods to replace the animal-product. (CHECK THIS)
[https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/eat-well/how-to-eat-a-balanced-diet/the-vegan-diet/]

For the remaining nutritients we go to the crust of the vegan pizza which represents what you consume through water. So water and supplements. The current scientific consensus recommends supplementing B12, D and omega 3.

**Vitamin D** deficiency is very common, so even when not going vegan it can be recommended to supplement. [About 1 billion people worldwide have vitamin D deficiency, while 50% of the population has vitamin D insufficiency https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/15050-vitamin-d-vitamin-d-deficiency]

How much vitamin D you need depends on where you live, age, skin color, weight, foods you eat, and certain health conditions. [https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/taking-too-much-vitamin-d-can-cloud-its-benefits-and-create-health-risks]

According to Harvard Medical School you probably don't need to supplement more than 15 to 20 mcg per day. Some may need a higher dose but unless your doctor recommends it, avoid taking more than 100mcg per day. [https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/taking-too-much-vitamin-d-can-cloud-its-benefits-and-create-health-risks]. And beware that it might be added in your fortified foods, so you can check that!

**Omega 3**
There are three essential types of Omega 3: ALA, EPA and DHA. ALA is contained in vegetable oils and nuts (especially walnuts), chia seed [https://www.vegansociety.com/resources/nutrition-and-health/nutrients/omega-3-and-omega-6-fats], flax seeds and flaxseed oil and leafy vegetables. [ https://academic.oup.com/ajcn/article/100/suppl_1/443S/4576604] So you will get this easily when following the vegan pizza.

Then there are two other forms of omega 3: EPA and DHA. Your body converts ALA into DHA and EPA but this conversion isn't very efficient, so on a plant-based diet it is recommended to supplement 250 to 500 mg combined EPA and DHA for healthy adults [https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/how-much-omega-3#general-guidelines]

**B12**
Then finally and maybe most importantly! The only nutrient that you can not naturally get by eating plant-based foods: Vitamin B12. [https://www.vegansociety.com/resources/nutrition-and-health/nutrients/vitamin-b12/what-every-vegan-should-know-about-vitamin-b12] A type of B12 is in some natural plantbased products, but this type is not properly absorbed, and the current consensus is that supplementation or fortified foods are reliable sources of B12 in contrast to natural products. [https://www.vegansociety.com/resources/nutrition-and-health/nutrients/vitamin-b12/what-every-vegan-should-know-about-vitamin-b12]

If you're doing a daily supplementation take at least 10mcg per day [https://www.vegansociety.com/resources/nutrition-and-health/nutrients/vitamin-b12] and at most 1000 mcg. [https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/taking-too-much-vitamin-d-can-cloud-its-benefits-and-create-health-risks] This maximum is so high because B12 is a water-soluble vitamine which makes high doseges generally considered safe [https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/too-much-vitamin-b12#helpful-or-harmful]

If you only supplement weekly, it is recommended to take at least 2000mcg. I know, daily at least 10, weekly at least 2000. The number don't add up, but trust me. This is just how vitamin b12 works. You can check the references if you want to learn more! [https://www.vegansociety.com/resources/nutrition-and-health/nutrients/vitamin-b12/what-every-vegan-should-know-about-vitamin-b12]


If you eat vegan you absolutely need to supplement vitamin B12 or consume foods with fortified B12. At least, that's what the current scientific consensus says.
