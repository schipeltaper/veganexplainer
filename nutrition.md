What follows is each nutrient to look out for when going on a plant-based diet, combined with how to get sufficient amounts. In this entire video and research we are focussing on healthy non-pregnant adults.

## Protein
|

## Iron
The amount of iron you need is:

    8.7mg a day for men over 18
    14.8mg a day for women aged 19 to 50
    8.7mg a day for women over 50
> [https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/vitamins-and-minerals/iron/](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/vitamins-and-minerals/iron/)

"People who follow a vegan diet need 1.8 times the RDA, compared with those who eat meat. This is due to the fact that nonheme iron is not as readily available to your body as heme iron"
> [https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/how-much-iron-per-day#influencing-factors](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/how-much-iron-per-day#influencing-factors)

#### UI
"Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL) - the highest amount you can safely consume - is 40-45 mg per day for iron, depending on your sex and age"
> [https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/how-much-iron-per-day#influencing-factors](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/how-much-iron-per-day#influencing-factors)

#### Pro iron tip
Pairing high-iron foods with ingredients that are high in vitamin C will enhance your body's ability to absorb iron. Some examples of nosh that's high in vitamin C are:

    Citrus fruits and citrus juice
    Chard
    Broccoli
    Red or green bell pepper
    Kiwi, strawberries, tomatoes, cantaloupe and papaya

Conversely, some foods can actually hinder your body's ability to absorb iron as well, including:

    Coffee, tea (even decaffeinated) and soda
    Dairy products and calcium supplements
    Foods high in dietary fiber
    Wine and beer

## Vit D
See video (or the script of the video)
## Iodine
Adults need 140 micrograms (mcg) of iodine a day.
> https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/vitamins-and-minerals/iodine/

iodized table salt:
There is approximately 71 mcg of iodine in 1/4 teaspoon of iodized salt, which is 47% of the daily recommended intake. However, salt also contains sodium (6Trusted Source, 17Trusted Source).

In the last few decades, iodine intake has decreased in the US. This is likely due to the push of major health organizations to restrict daily sodium intake to prevent or treat high blood pressure.

Nevertheless, salt only seems to raise blood pressure in salt-sensitive individuals, which is about 25% of the population (16, 18Trusted Source).

Other sources:
- one cup of cooked lima bean contains 16 mcg of iodine (https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/iodine-rich-foods#TOC_TITLE_HDR_5)
- Fruits: Few  fruits like   Strawberries, Cranberries and Pineapple are an excellent  and rich source of iodine.
Beans: Green beans and navy beans both  are called  for their high iodine content. Some  portion of green beans included  3/mcg of iodine that caters to 2% of the required a quantity  in the daily diet. (https://www.parashospitals.com/blogs/food-items-that-are-good-in-iodine)
- Seaweed:
    - Kombu Kelp: Kombu kelp can contain up to 2,984 mcg of iodine per seaweed sheet (1 gram). This provides almost 2,000% of the recommended daily intake (6Trusted Source. Excess iodine consumption is well-tolerated in the majority of people but could result in thyroid dysfunction for those who are susceptible
    - One study found that the average amount of iodine in wakame seaweed from various parts of the world was 66 mcg per gram
    - The iodine content in nori varies between 16-43 mcg per gram

## Omega-3 fatty acids
See video (or the script of the video). In the video we don't explain how to get enough Omega-3 ALA.

## Zinc
RDA:  The Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) for adults 19+ years is 11 mg a day for men and 8 mg for women. Pregnancy and lactation requires slightly more at 11 mg and 12 mg, respectively.

UL:  The Tolerable Upper Intake Level is the maximum daily intake unlikely to cause harmful effects on health. The UL for zinc is 40 mg daily for all males and females ages 19+ years.
> https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/zinc/

Perplexity AI:
    Here are some plant-based foods that are rich in zinc along with the amount of zinc they contain per serving:• Wheat germ (1/4 cup): 4.8 mg[1]
    - Fortified cereals (3/4 to 1 cup): 3.8-15 mg[1]
    - Beans and legumes (1 cup cooked): 2.5-3.4 mg[1][2]
    - Seeds (2 tablespoons): 0.9-2.8 mg[1][3]
    - Nuts (1 ounce): 0.6-1.3 mg[1][3]
    - Oatmeal (1 cup cooked): 1.05 mg[1]
    - Tofu (100 grams): 0.9 mg[3][4]
    - Spinach (1 cup cooked): 0.5 mg[1]
    It's important to note that the amount of zinc in these foods can vary depending on factors such as soil quality and processing methods, so it's a good idea to eat a variety of these foods to ensure adequate zinc intake [5]
